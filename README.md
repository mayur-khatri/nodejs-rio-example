# Building Scalable Data Products in R

This is an example project which exposes a simple API to get summary of the price of diamonds for a given random sample size

The statistical computation is performed in R and the HTTP requests are handled by nodejs.

We use `Rserve` and `rio` to connect R and nodejs.

This was presented as a flash talk at the R Data Scientists Bangalore meetup. Link to the slides - http://www.slideshare.net/raghothams/building-scalable-data-products-in-r
